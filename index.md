Welcome to my page, where I will be sharing all of my projects with _you guys. _I do this all mostly for fun, but also to learn a whole lot while I’m at it. Knowing me, most of these blog posts will be full of different **issues** I encounter, the stress incurred while facing them, and how after many tries I will finally be able to  _“slay the dragon_”, or so to speak. 

Some of the points I’ll be covering in this blog are:



* **Virtual Machines**
* **Building Computers**
* **SIEM management**
* **Red Teaming**
* **Blue Teaming**
* **And many more!**

So I hope you have **fun** while reading these posts, but I also hope a good chunk of you are able to learn something from these as well. We won’t be perfect and able to solve any problem, that takes a whole lot of **learning** and **experience**, and it's something we can work towards together.
